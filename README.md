Hi, I made this AI to help you with your tasks. It can listen to you through the microphone and respond accordingly. I created it using an OpenAI model in Python, along with a JSON file for configuration. In this JSON file, you can adjust your OpenAI API key and the language of the voices, which uses pyttsx3. If you want to change the language of the voices, simply adjust the number in the "config" section of the JSON file - 0 for Spanish, 1 for English, and there are more voices available (I think from 0 to 3), so you can choose the one you like the most. I'm currently working on making it compatible with Twitch and YouTube. You can choose to communicate with it via text or voice, and also adjust the personality in the JSON file for the way you want it to respond.
